%   GL(z) = 2 H(z);    GH(z) = -2 H(-z)
% This filter bank has an alias cancelling property, but does introduce
% a ripple into the end-to-end frequency response. The design procedure
% minimizes a weighted combination of the ripple energy and the stopband
% energy of the lowpass prototype filter. The design procedure is motivated
% by a paper by Jain and Crochiere.

% System under consideration (ignoring aliasing)
%   B(z) = 1/2 ( GL(z) HL(z) + GH(z) HH(z) )
% Each filter has N = 2*M coefficients and is symmetric.
% The component filters are based on a symmetric lowpass prototype,
%   H(z) = z^(-(N-1)) H(1/z)
% The polyphase decomposition of H(z) is
%   H(z) = H0(z^2) + z^(-1) H1(z^2)
% where because of the symmetry of H(z) (and N being even)
%   H1(z) = z^(-(M-1)) H0(1/z).
%
% The design strategy is to find H0(z), use this to form H(z) and then get
% the component filters. An iterative procedure is used.
% - Start with an initial H0(z)
% - Begin iteration
%   - Find H(z) from H0(z).
%   - Find GL(z) and GH(z) from H(z)
%   - Express the B(z) in terms of GL(z), GH(z), HL(z) and HH(z), where
%     HL(z) and HH(z) are unknown, but depend only on a new H0(z) which is
%     to be determined.
%   - Find a new H0(z) which minimizes the ripple in B(z) and the stopband
%     energy in H(z). Note that this H0(z) will not necessarily cancel
%     aliasing.
%   - Iterate
% In the limit, there will be no change in H(z). Using this value of H(z),
% the filters in the alias cancelling filter bank can be determined.

% Notes:
% - One can use a permutation of H0(z) in the design. One such permutation
%   is the first (or second) half of of the symmetric lowpass filter.
% - The stopband energy criterion also affects the passband ripple of
%   the lowpass prototype. The ripple criterion (on the overall filter
%   bank impulse response) essentially forces the transition region
%   (pi-fsb, fsb) of the prototype to have the correct symmetry such that
%   frequency response of the overall filter bank is (approximately)
%   constant.
% - The ripple error measurement omits terms known to be zero in the
%   overall filter bank response. The design procedure gives the "same"
%   results if these terms are included.
% - This implementation of the Jain & Crochiere algorithm does not
%   converge when implemented as per their paper. The error
%   (h0' (PAP + alpha PFP) h0) does not decrease monotonically.
%   The fix was a more cautious update:
%     - Previous filter is h0p
