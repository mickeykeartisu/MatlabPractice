History of updates

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr161 (23/Nobember/2000)

Minor updates. Some useful tools are introduced.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr16 (08/Nobember/1999)

Minor bug fix to the previous version. This version is still tentative.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr15 (23/September/1999)

A major extension on synthetic source is implemented. The new synthesis 
routine uses aperiodicity information in synthesis. There are several
obvious refinement plans. Therefore, this version will be replaced soon.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr11 (03/September/1999)

A major extension on source characteristics is implemented in this
revision. An ad-hoc periodicity model was introduced and seems working
reasonably. The older part is still effective and it allows you to
compare different revisions. Detailed discussion can be found in
Eurospeech'99 and IEICEJ/ASJ technical report 07.1999.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr10 (01/August/1999)

A minor bug in refineF02.m is fixed.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr10 (01/August/1999)

Stabilized maintenance version. New series is under development
by Dr. Zolfaghari.

(1) F0 refinement using multiple harmonic components is introduced.
(2) Asymmetric envelope shaping is introduced.
(3) some parameter tweeking based on the DRT test by Dr. Zolfaghari.
(4) Additional parameter tweeking using EGG data.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr9 (25/July/1999)

Stabilized maintenance version. New series is under development
by Dr. Zolfaghari.

(1) Irrelevant GUI buttons are disabled.
(2) Synthesis source wave is revised.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30kr9 (18/July/1999)

Stabilized maintenance version. New series is under development
by Dr. Zolfaghari.

(1) V/UV decision is crisp.
(2) Spectrum smoothing  mode is crisp.
(3) Small bug in synthesis was fixed.
(4) C/N ratio compensation is disabled. Raw estimation is used instead.

Release note: STRAIGHTV30r7 (17/May/1999)

(1) New sampling frequency (12,500 Hz) was added.
(2) F0 search upper limit, higher than 1 kHz, properly works now.
(3) Bugs in F0 tracking algorithm were fixed.
(4) Byte order for plane binary file can be selected now.
(5) Multi band analysis was tentatively disabled.
(6) Bugs in aiffread.m were fixed.
(7) Small pop-noise in resynthesized speech is reduced.
